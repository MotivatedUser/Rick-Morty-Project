Rick and Morty App
This is a web application that displays information about characters from the Rick and Morty universe. The application uses the Rick and Morty API to fetch character data and display it on the site. The app was built using React, and includes features like pagination, search functionality, and filtering by character status and gender.

Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to build this app:

React
React DOM
Axios
React Icons
React Scripts

Features
The Rick and Morty App includes the following features:

Displaying character data from the Rick and Morty API
Pagination to browse through multiple pages of characters
Search functionality to search for characters by name
Filtering by character status and gender

Learning Outcomes
This project was built to explore and learn about integrating data from a third-party API into a React app. Through this project, I learned about using axios to fetch data, useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and side effects, and async and await to handle asynchronous API requests. I also gained experience with React components, props, and event handling.

Deployment
This app was deployed to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages package. 

Credits
The character data used in this app was provided by the Rick and Morty API.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
